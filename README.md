Celtics Operations Database

Being a professional athlete can be challenging as there are so many different components to keep track of (Ex: Practice schedules, contract information, player stats). In order to combat this, we wanted to create a database that holds all of this information in one place. Our tool will be applicable to all players of the Boston Celtics, the coaches of the organization, and the league commisioner, granting different kinds of permissions to the different users. For example, players can only get information regarding practices or stats where as coaches will have the permission to put and post practice schedules. The league commisioner on the other hand, will have more access to features like posting and deleting games.
